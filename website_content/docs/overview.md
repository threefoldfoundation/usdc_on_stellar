## Introduction

The following present the general process to buy USDC on an exchange and send it to a Stellar wallet.

While the steps to buy USDC will differ from one exchange to another, the general process will be similar.

## Step 1: Create an Account on a CEX
1. Choose a centralized exchange (CEX) that supports USDC. Examples include:
   - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/usd-coin)
   - [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/usdc)
   - [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/price/usd-coin)
   - [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-usdc-usdc)
   - [OKX](https://www.okx.com/buy-usdc#sourceQuote=cad)
2. Go to the exchange's website and click on "Sign Up" or "Create Account."
3. Fill in the required information (email, password, etc.) and agree to the terms of use.

## Step 2: Complete the KYC Verification
1. Most exchanges require a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
2. Go to your account settings and find the KYC section.
3. Upload the necessary identification documents (e.g., passport, driver's license) and proof of address (e.g., utility bill).
4. Wait for the exchange to verify your identity. This process may take a few minutes to a few days.

## Step 3: Deposit Funds
1. Once your account is verified, go to the "Deposit" section of the exchange.
2. Choose the method you want to use to deposit funds (bank transfer, credit/debit card, etc.).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deposit:
   - If using a bank transfer, follow the bank instructions provided by the exchange.
   - If using a card, enter your card information and confirm the transaction.
4. Wait for the funds to reflect in your exchange account.

## Step 4: Buy USDC
1. Navigate to the "Markets" or "Trade" section of the exchange.
2. Look for the USDC trading pair that corresponds with the currency you deposited (e.g., USDC/USD, USDC/BTC).
3. Select the trading pair and click on the "Buy" button.
4. Enter the amount of USDC you want to purchase.
5. Review the order details and confirm the transaction.

## Step 5: Obtain Your Stellar Wallet Address
1. Open your Stellar wallet application. If you donâ€™t have one, consider using wallets like:
   - [Lobstr](https://lobstr.co/)
   - [StellarX](https://www.stellarx.com/)
   - [StellarTerm](https://stellarterm.com/)
   - [Solar Wallet](https://solarwallet.io/)
2. Go to the "Receive" or "Deposit" section within your wallet.
3. Copy your Stellar wallet address, ensuring you include the entire address as it is case-sensitive.

## Step 6: Transfer USDC to Your Stellar Wallet
1. Go back to the centralized exchange where you bought your USDC.
2. Navigate to the "Withdraw" section.
3. Select USDC as the cryptocurrency you want to withdraw.
4. Paste your Stellar wallet address that you copied in Step 5.
5. Enter the amount of USDC you want to send.
6. Review the transaction details carefully. Double-check the wallet address to avoid losing funds.
7. Confirm the withdrawal and follow any additional security steps (e.g., two-factor authentication).

## Conclusion
You have successfully purchased USDC on a CEX and sent it to your Stellar wallet. Always double-check wallet addresses and transaction details to avoid errors. Additionally, ensure you keep your wallet secure by using strong passwords and enabling features like two-factor authentication.
